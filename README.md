# 🌍 Decentralized Heritage Digitization Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 platform for global collaboration in digitizing and preserving cultural heritage! This project addresses the real-world problem of cultural heritage loss due to conflicts, environmental degradation, and limited access to resources. By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, it enables decentralized contributions from experts, communities, and enthusiasts worldwide, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and incentivized participation while preventing data silos and centralized control.

## ✨ Features

🌐 Global contributor registry for experts, museums, and locals  
📸 Submit and collaborate on digitization proposals for artifacts, sites, and documents  
🔍 Immutable verification of digital assets to ensure authenticity  
💰 Token-based crowdfunding and rewards for contributors  
🗳️ DAO governance for community-driven project approvals  
🎨 NFT minting for digitized heritage items with royalty sharing  
🔒 Access controls for sensitive cultural data  
📊 Analytics for tracking preservation progress  
🚫 Dispute resolution for collaborative conflicts  
🌟 Cross-chain compatibility for broader accessibility (via Stacks' Bitcoin anchoring)

## 🛠 How It Works

This platform uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to orchestrate the entire ecosystem. Here's a high-level overview:

1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Handles registration of users (contributors, verifiers, curators) with roles and KYC-like proofs to build trust in a decentralized manner.
2. **ProposalSubmission.clar**: Allows users to submit heritage items for digitization, including metadata like location, historical significance, and initial hashes of preliminary scans.
3. **TaskManagement.clar**: Creates and assigns collaborative tasks (e.g., 3D scanning, photography, transcription) with milestones and deadlines.
4. **VerificationEngine.clar**: Verifies submitted digital assets against hashes, using multi-signature approvals from verifiers to confirm accuracy and prevent forgeries.
5. **FundingPool.clar**: Manages token pools for crowdfunding specific digitization projects, with automated releases based on milestone completions.
6. **NFTMinter.clar**: Mints NFTs representing digitized heritage items, storing immutable metadata on-chain and linking to IPFS for high-res files.
7. **RoyaltyDistributor.clar**: Automatically distributes royalties from NFT sales or donations to original contributors, communities, and ongoing preservation funds.
8. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Enables token holders to vote on proposals, disputes, and platform upgrades, ensuring democratic control.

**For Contributors (e.g., Archaeologists or Locals)**  
- Register via UserRegistry with your credentials.  
- Submit a proposal using ProposalSubmission, including a hash of your initial data.  
- Join tasks in TaskManagement and upload digitized content.  
- Earn rewards through FundingPool and RoyaltyDistributor upon verification.

**For Verifiers (e.g., Experts or Institutions)**  
- Register and get assigned roles.  
- Use VerificationEngine to review and approve submissions with your signature.  
- Participate in GovernanceDAO votes to resolve disputes or approve new projects.

**For Funders and Enthusiasts**  
- Contribute tokens to FundingPool for specific proposals.  
- Purchase NFTs via NFTMinter to own a piece of digital heritage.  
- Vote in GovernanceDAO to influence which heritage items get prioritized.

**For All Users**  
- Query analytics across contracts to track global progress.  
- All actions are timestamped and immutable on Stacks, anchored to Bitcoin for ultimate security.
